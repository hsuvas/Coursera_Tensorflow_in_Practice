# Coursera_Tensorflow_in_Practice

This repository contains various programming files from Coursera's Tensorflow in Practise Specialisation that I wrote during the course.

The specialisation contains four Courses:
      
        1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
        2. Convolutional Neural Networks in Tensorflow
        3. Natural Language Processing in Tensorflow
        4. Sequenes, time-series and Prediction
 The Specialization can be found at:https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice
